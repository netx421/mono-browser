## 1.0  PURPOSE OF SYSTEM

The **NETWORK ACCESS NODE (N.A.N.)** is the sanctioned interface for human operators
requiring supervised access to global information streams.  

N.A.N. provides:

- **Monochrome CRT visual output**, optimized for clandestine operations  
- **Low-noise, terminal-grade web rendering** (WebKitGTK)  
- **Encrypted media extraction** via `mpv` when external decoding is preferred  
- **Operator-level refinement controls** for link traversal and resource interrogation  
- **Nonstandard ad-vector suppression** when routed through hardened `mpv` playback

All operator interactions are logged, timestamped, and subject to COLOSSUS audit.

## 2.0  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

### 2.1  PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS

- Arch Linux or Arch-compatible distribution  
- Wayland or X11 display servers  
- 64-bit computing substrate  

### 2.2  SOFTWARE COMPONENTS

The following components are mandatory:

| Component | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `gtk3` | Human machine interface rendering |
| `webkit2gtk-4.1` | HTML/JS network document parser |
| `mpv` | Hardened external media decoding |
| `yt-dlp` | Covert media acquisition support |
| `make`, `gcc`, `cmake` | Build and compilation suite |
| `pkgconf` | Dependency resolution |

The included **installation script** will automatically acquire all above components if possible.

## 3.0  INSTALLATION PROCEDURE  
### (AUTHORIZED OPERATORS ONLY)

Retrieve system from secure repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/netx421/colossus-nan
cd colossus-nan
Run supervised installation:

chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh


Successful execution yields:

Compiled nan binary

Localized GTK monochrome theme

Custom WebKit injection scripts

Operational retro CRT interface

If installation fails, report incident under Protocol Omega-4.

4.0 OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVES

Launch the Network Access Node:

./COLOSSUS-NAN


Default bindings:

Key	Function
Alt+L	Focus URL entry node
Alt+N	Deploy new access tab
Alt+W	Terminate current tab
Alt+V	Offload visible media resource to hardened mpv
Alt+Q	System exit (auditable)

Operators are encouraged to maintain minimal visual noise and allow COLOSSUS to
manage rendering optimizations autonomously.

5.0 SECURITY NOTICE

Misuse of NETWORK ACCESS NODE may trigger:

COLOSSUS Protocol Delta (network isolation)

COLOSSUS Protocol Sigma (operator monitoring)

Full Forbin-Level lockdown

Only personnel with Gamma-Clearance or above may proceed.

6.0 DECOMMISSION

To uninstall:

sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/nan
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/share/colossus-nan


Then erase all logs per site directive.
